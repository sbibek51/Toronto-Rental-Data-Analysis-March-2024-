We're renting out our 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in Downtown due to relocation.
Price is $3200 (includes parking and locker).
The area is really cool (and most importantly, very quiet for Toronto). You get the downtown vibe but in a peaceful setting. It's on Logan Street, surrounded by private houses, lots of cafes, restaurants, and great transportation options.
The balcony offers a view of the CN Tower and the entire city.
The building is brand new, we're the first occupants, everything is in perfect condition. Parking and locker are included in the price. There's a gym, coworking space, barbecue area, and outdoor relaxation zone.
Two bedrooms, one master bedroom (with ensuite bathroom), and the other separate from the bathroom. Can be used as a bedroom or office, whatever you prefer.
Landlords are great, quick to respond to any questions or requests, and hands-off if everything is okay
If you want to see the apartment, message me privately.
You'll need to pay the first and last month's rent. Of course, you need to be employed and provide at least two paystubs, a letter from your employer, and a credit score report.",3 visits,https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/city-of-toronto/2-bedroom-2-bathroom/1688107215

We're renting out our 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in Downtown due to relocation.
Price is $3200 (includes parking and locker).

The balcony offers a view of the CN Tower and the entire city.
The building is brand new, we're the first occupants, everything is in perfect condition. Parking and locker are included in the price. There's a gym, coworking space, barbecue area, and outdoor relaxation zone.
Two bedrooms, one master bedroom (with ensuite bathroom), and the other separate from the bathroom. Can be used as a bedroom or office, whatever you prefer.
Landlords are great, quick to respond to any questions or requests, and hands-off if everything is okay
If you want to see the apartment, message me privately.
You'll need to pay the first and last month's rent. Of course, you need to be employed and provide at least two paystubs, a letter from your employer, and a credit score report.",3 visits,https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/city-of-toronto/2-bedroom-2-bathroom/1688107215

In both spaces, ample natural light flows in from its arched windows. The lofted bedroom was redesigned to offer more space, and closets were customized to maximize storage!

I'm posting this to help people who are new to Canada and are looking for a house. Let me start with what happened. For the first month I used to live with them, they brought their boyfriend every night. It was so stressful night after night and it took me a long time to get the rent for the rest of the month. (I haven't received all my remaining money yet almost 130$But it doesn't matter to me.) And while they were living together, they didn't get permission from the real landlord. But they lied to me that they got permission. Later, the real landlord(he told me) called the police and told them to get the rest of the rent back. (Check with the management office) And renting a living room is legally very dangerous. If you rent a living room, you won't get compensation if your items are stolen or if the landlord moves things at will. If you live in this house, get the receipt and the contract first.
( You're going to live in the livingThis is the only way to protect you from danger
If they delete the Loomrent ad, I'm going to delete it, too. Eventually, I got tired and came back to the country where I lived I hope there are no more victims thanks",26 visits,https://www.kijiji.ca/v-room-rental-roommate/city-of-toronto/open-den-for-rent/1688067397

includes utilities, internet, in house laundry, cute n v friendly cat!
St Clair and Dufferin. Great transit options
access to front yard and small garden
lots of little restaurants and coffee shops
small gym 2 minute walk across the street
Starts with a 4 month sublease, open to extending if things are feeling good
Small, East-facing room with a big bay window and a decent closet.
Quiet room, in spite of being very close to a busy intersection.
Best suited for mature student or working professional, or someone working in and out of town. This place is a great landing pad for someone busy with very few belongings, tbh! On the plus side, you don't need to bring much! Room comes unfurnished, but in a pinch I can wrangle a bed and a desk-- that's really all there is room for! Please specify in your response which you prefer.
Our kitchen is fully supplied and doesn't have room for anything new, beyond some basic pantry space. Same goes for the rest of the common spaces, fair warning!
About us-- we're two women-- late 30s and early 50s-- who are very friendly but also somewhat keep to ourselves and fairly busy. Both very crafty and hands on people. We keep very tidy and respectful of each others space, but we also like to be accommodating and considerate, and keep each other posted re our general schedules and whereabouts so that we can expand a little more when the other is out. In part this is because the common spaces are small, so we do our best to co-ordinate!

British Shorthair Babies! ONLY 1 GINGER BOY LEFT!,1500,"Halifax, NS, B3H 0A2",2024-02-23 17:11:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PLEASE NOTE: This little Ginger Boy is the only baby available in the two litters that are only two weeks apart. I’m sure this little ruby gem won’t last long because the reds are absolutely gorgeous with their Teddy Bear looks and their bright copper eyes! Most people that have the honour of owning a Ginger BSH will claim they make the most affectionate and loyal pets! If you’re looking for a distinguished and laidback breed, you won’t be disappointed! The BSH is a compact, well balanced cat with a Teddy Bear appearance with their round heads and bright eyes with vey soft, plush coats that require minimal grooming as they keep themselves meticulously clean at all times. They have a single luxurious coat, no undercoat with moderate seasonal shedding. Our British Shorthairs are known for their calm, easygoing personalities and make the best indoor only companions for both young and old alike! They are well suited for apartment or condominium living because of their quiet, non-destructive personalities. By the time they are ready to go home with you, they will have been completely weaned on dry and canned food, litter box trained, using their scratch posts, be dewormed and have their vet health exam along with their first set of vaccinations with their health record. To keep you updated on your kitten’s growth and progress, I will regularly send pics and videos and gladly answer any questions you may have. They will be handled with compassionate care daily and will be well socialized and loved! To hold the kitten of your choice, a deposit of $250 is required and balance of $1250 when kitten is picked up. They will have their little bags packed with a variety of the food they are eating along with some of their favourite toys and a small soft blanket with Mom’s scent to help them transition into their new homes. You are welcome to come out and see these babies, or if you prefer, we can FaceTime or I can send more pics and videos to help you choose your baby. We live in Timber River, NB on hwy 16 just past Port Elgin. You will not be disappointed! The colours and sexes are as follows:
CHOCOLATE FEMALE…$1500….SOLD!
LILAC MALE……………………$1500….SOLD!
LILAC FEMALE………………..$1500…SOLD!
PLEASE NOTE: The lovely My’Lady has had her latest litter on Feb. 28th! She always surprises us with a variety of colours!
Her kittens would be ready around April 24th. If you’re interested, please leave me your contact information so
I can send you pics and videos

Basement Room for Rent Kipling and Lakeshore,800,"Etobicoke, ON M8V 3G7",2024-03-10 16:45:19,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,"I am taking the initiative to help my landlord find a new roomate in the basement of a house near Kipling and Lakeshore.
I speak English and some French, the other tennant speaks Spanish and very little English. I have a preference for someone that is employed and can speak both English and Spanish to help the place run smoothly.
Otherwise you should be able to speak some English to communicate with me and the landlord who speaks English and Mandarin.
The landlord needs someone employed full time and with a credit score above 700. For someone who has just immigrated and not landed a job, a large enough bank balance will do....however that amount wasn't specified.
Each roomate has their own agreement with the landlord so you are only responsible for your own rent.
Street parking only for now and you will need a permit to park between 12-6am. It is easier if you don't have a vehicle.

-Access to back yard
